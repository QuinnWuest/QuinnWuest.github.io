                <h2>On the Subject of Not Chess</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This ain’t chess, it’s a computer.</p>

                <p>This module takes place on a 6×6 checkerboard, shown to the right. You play as white, while the computer plays as black.</p>
				<ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
					<li>Pieces (or men) move diagonally forward one square at a time.</li>
					<li>You can only move onto an empty dark square.</li>
					<li>If an opponent’s man is diagonally adjacent, and the square immediately beyond it is empty, you can jump over it and capture it.</li>
					<li>Captures are mandatory — if you can jump, you must.</li>
					<li>Multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn.</li>
					<li>When a man reaches the last row, it becomes a king. Kings can move and capture both forwards and backwards.
						<ul><li>If a player’s man captures an opponent’s man and becomes a king simultaneously, their turn ends immediately. They cannot continue their turn with a backwards capture.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>You win by capturing all of your opponent’s men or blocking them so they have no legal moves.</li>
				</ul>
                
				<p>Every 108 seconds, you must use the buttons to make your move. From the moment the alarm sounds, you will have 40 seconds make any valid move on the checkerboard.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 10pt;">The time remaining is calculated by taking the displayed letter’s alphabetic position (A0-Z25), multiplying it by 10, and adding the displayed number.</p>
				
				<p>Enter your move by pressing the letter and number buttons to input the starting and ending coordinates. (Most moves require two coordinate entries, though additional inputs may be needed if multiple captures occur in the same turn.)</p>
				
				<p>On every move after the first, your opponent will also move a man. The start and end positions of the opponent’s move are indicated by the LEDs at the bottom of the module, with a short pause between them. The green LED shows the file (a–f), while the red LED shows the rank (1–6). If a yellow LED lights up, it indicates that the rank and file are the same (e.g., a1, b2, etc.).</p>
				
				<p>When approximately 40% of the bomb’s modules are solved, when the timer reaches three minutes, or when either player has no remaining moves, the LEDs at the bottom of the module will light up solid. At this point, use the tables on the next page to enter two coordinates to disarm the module.</p>

					<p><u>Note:</u> This checkers game follows the rules of <em>American Checkers/English Draughts</em>.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Men cannot capture backwards; only kings can.</li>
						<li>When a man becomes a king, their turn ends immediately. If the crowning occurs during a jump, they may not continue by jumping backwards.</li>
						<li>Kings move only one square at a time.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These rules differ from those used in <a href="Shashki.html">International Draughts</a>. In that variant:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Men can (and must) capture backwards.</li>
						<li>If a man becomes a king during a jump, they may continue their turn with a backward capture.</li>
						<li>Kings may move any number of squares along a diagonal.</li>
					</ul>
