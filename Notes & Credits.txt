Tournament Notes:
Filename format goes as follows: Username-t#-index-allignment.
Username is for the user of the avatar or the team captain.
T# refers to the tournament number. (8T# refers to the 8p tournament number.)
- imbapingu-t8- avatars were resized and recentered by QuinnWuest. They are all named after team captain imbapingu, as each res and spy avatar was randomly picked by each of the team members.
- Avatars for team not.last in Tournament 3 are not present. Each member had a base avatar that was randomly rotated. Bremen-2&3- and ansonberns- avatars came from this tournament, but remain in the PROAVALON folder due to their extended use.
